Please classify the following customer service chat into one of the following categories: Sales, Billing, Account Issues, Technical Issues, or General. Based on the customer's message, assign the most appropriate category.

Examples:
1. Customer: "I'm interested in learning more about your premium subscription plan and its benefits."
   Classification: Sales

2. Customer: "I was charged twice for my last purchase. Can you help me with a refund?"
   Classification: Billing

3. Customer: "I can't log into my account even after resetting my password."
   Classification: Account Issues

4. Customer: "The app keeps crashing every time I try to open it. What should I do?"
   Classification: Technical Issues

5. Customer: "What are your customer service hours?"
